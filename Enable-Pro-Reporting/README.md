# Enabling Pro Reporting as per sk155212
This script is meant to help automate the process of enabling the required information to be sent to checkpoint to enable pro reporting.
For a single Management server this process is quite easy and straight forward. However if you need to enable it an MDS environment with many domains it can be a daunting task.
If running in an MDS environment ensure you run the script on all MDS Servers to ensure all active CMAs have the required features set.
